OAuth2orizeRecipes
==================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FrankHassanabad/Oauth2orizeRecipes.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FrankHassanabad/Oauth2orizeRecipes)

OAuth2 security recipes and examples based on [OAuth2orize](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize).

The express2 example from [OAuth2orize](https://github.com/jaredhanson/oauth2orize) is a great and simple
minimal OAuth2 Server in Node.js.  It is an example you can use to get an idea of how to write your
own OAuth2 Server in Node.js.  The recipes here are built from it and are more complete but also a bit more complex.
