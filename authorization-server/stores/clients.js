 * This is the configuration of the clients that are allowed to connected to your authorization server.

 * id: (A unique numeric id of your client application )
 * name: (The name of your client application)
 * clientId: (A unique id of your client application)
 * clientSecret: (A unique password(ish) secret that is _best not_ shared with anyone but your client
 *     application and the authorization server.
 *
 * Optionally you can set these properties which are
 * trustedClient: (default if missing is false.  If this is set to true then the client is regarded as a
 *     trusted client and not a 3rd party application.  That means that the user will not be presented with
 *     a decision dialog with the trusted application and that the trusted application gets full scope access
 *     without the user having to make a decision to allow or disallow the scope access.
