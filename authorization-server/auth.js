// Register serialialization and deserialization functions.

// When a client redirects a user to user authorization endpoint, an
// authorization transaction is initiated.  To complete the transaction, the
// user must authenticate and approve the authorization request.  Because this
// may involve multiple HTTPS request/response exchanges, the transaction is
// stored in the session.
//
// An application must supply serialization functions, which determine how the
// client object is serialized into the session.  Typically this will be a
// simple matter of serializing the client's ID, and deserializing by finding
// the client by ID from the database.
